**Wordle Part 2** is an app that extends the Wordle Lab 1 Application from CodePath. Where in the second part of this application, our goal was to incorporate other key features and elements for the application. In the version, a user can now select the number of rows and/or guesses they would like with their game, change the theme of the game to either 'Standard', 'Countries', or 'Animals'. This version also include the "Alien Wordle" feature. Where everytime a user gueses a word incorrectly within a row, a new word is generated; which increases the difficulty of the game. 

Time spent: **3** hours spent in total

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [x] User can change the number of letters per row (the length of the goal word)
- [x] User can change the numbers of rows on the board (how many guesses allowed)
- [x] User can select a new themed set to pull the goal word from
- [x] User can select "alien wordle", causing the goal word to change after each guess


The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [x] App displays a reset button on the top left to reset the game (but make no changes to the settings)

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
